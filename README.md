# Automated_Hospital
This repository contains the entire idea of making out the hospital management system to the next extreme level featured through MySQL(Backend) and JAVA_SWING(frontend)

Additionally, we made it little easy to implement and understand the core concept with making out two iterative version v1 and v2 respectively, 
through which v1 is ultimately for beginners and v2 is intermediate and complex system to deal with and little hard to manipulate.
